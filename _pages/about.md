Hi! I am Johannes Lattmann, a doctoral researcher at the [Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences]([https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/gess/), at the University of Mannheim. I am also an associate researcher at the Chair of Comparative Politics with Prof. Marc Debus and teach courses on quantitive text analysis and research design.

I focus on political behaviour and political economy in European democracies, examining changes in public opinion and attitudes. In my dissertation I concentrate on the consequences of the allocation of EU place-based policies. In my research I apply econometric, experimental and quasi-experimental designs as well as NLP approaches. 

Before my start in Mannheim, I obtained a M.Sc at the [London School of Economic & Political Sciences](https://www.lse.ac.uk/) and a B.A in Social Science from from [Humboldt-University Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en/).

On this website, you can learn more about my research and download my CV. Please reach out if you have want to [connect](mailto:Johannes.lattmann@uni-mannheim.de).
